# Yulu
Yulu is Indiaâ€™s leading micro-mobility service provider, which offers unique vehicles for the daily commute. Starting off as a mission to eliminate traffic congestion in India, Yulu provides the safest commute solution through a user-friendly mobile app to enable shared, solo and sustainable commuting.

# Business Problem
Yulu has recently suffered considerable dips in its revenues. They have contracted a consulting company to understand the factors on which the demand for these shared electric cycles depends. Specifically, they want to understand the factors affecting the demand for these shared electric cycles in the Indian market.

# Approach Used
Here, I have done EDA like finding shape of dataframe, detecting null values, detecting the outliers and clipping them. Visualized the data using countplots, histograms, piecharts and heatmap which gave a better understanding about data. Formulated the null and alternate hypothesis and conducted T-Test, Chi-square test, Anova/Kruskal Test which helped to find out the relation between dependent and independent variables. This helped to find valuable insights from the data and provide recommendations to the company on how tackle with its decreasing revenue and optimise its operations.
